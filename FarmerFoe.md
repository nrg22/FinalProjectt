### Meet the Farmer 
In the beginning there were three farmers in the village. During the period of liberation, Steve took away all the farming jobs. After making a farm, only one farmer was allowed to work. To view farmer's potential trades, click [here.](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Trading#Farmer)

### Potatoe Drought
This farmer was traded with until he became an apprentice. Steve decided it was time to give him another work companion. After a discovery of **potatoes** were made in an abandoned ship, they were planted in the same farm. Soon, both the farmers replaced the potatoe plants with wheat leaving a drought in potatoes with no other possibility of getting more. This angered Steve and took the other work companion away.

### Taxes
With this background in mind, Steve was trying to encourage mating between the villagers to increase the population. The farmer got mad at Steve's attempts and began to tax him, and tell other workers to also tax steve. With steve in control of the economy, a recession was about to begin if prices were to high. And so, Steve destroyed the farmer's working block.

### Resistance
The working block is what gives the villager there job. Without it, they are unemployed. Despite this, the farmer retained his position as the town farmer, and Steve had no other option but to return the block.

### Forgiveness
After a couple of days and trades, the farmer forgave Steve, and now they are on good terms.
