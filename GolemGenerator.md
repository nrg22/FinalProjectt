### Meet the Golem
In the beginning there were one iron golem in the village. He is there to protect the people. As he gets damaged, he rusts and eventually dissapears. More iron golems spawn if there is a village of people with atleast 75% of them having worked in the past day.

### Skeleton Murders
When iron golems sense that a monster is dangerous, they attack. Because of the wall Steve built around the town, golems only have to defend inside the village. Sometimes, they will try to pick fights with mosters on the other side of the wall. Due to elevation, some skeltons have been able to shoot and murder golems. This led to a drop of amount of golems in the town. It went from five, to three.

### Spawning Drought
For more Iron Golems to spawn, there needs to be a bed assigned to each villager. Due to a deranged villager who refused to sleep, the golems stopped spawning, and the threat of skeletons was still real. This led to Steve having to murder said villager in the night when no villagers were awake to witness.

### Growth
After the murdering of the derganged villagers, more iron golems were able to spawn. Their population is now up to 8!
