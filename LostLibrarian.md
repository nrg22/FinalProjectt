### Meet the Librarian
The librarian is very useful to the village. Because of this, he is housed in the main palace, leading directly to the townsquare. In the temple, he is on the left side, and the cleric is on the right. After enough upgrading, the librarian can trade enchanted books.

### The first librarian
The first librarian was very kind and humble. He believed that everyone should have the knowledge he read in his books. He would go around talking to regular villagers about the things he learned. Unfortunately one night, a zombie spawned in the palace and converted him into a zombie. Although potions could be created to heal him, there was no cleric at the time, and the town wasn't developed enought to know how. An iron golem later took his life as he tried to attack the townsman.

### The second librarian
One of the children who the librarian often spoke to, grew up and decided to be the librarian. He is still the only librarian in the town, and although more introverted, still follows the philospohy of the previous librarian and shares knowledge with the whole town.
