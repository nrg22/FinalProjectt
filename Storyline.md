### What is Minecraft
Minecraft is a game where a player is inserted into a 3D world with infinite terrain. There is no designated objective. Players are free to choose what to do, which typically includes exploring, extracting raw materials, and creating tools and structures.

### My Storyline
In the world that I have created, the main character Steve is a being who randomly gained consciousness. As he attempts to understand the world around him, he comes across a village. In this town, there are five people total; three farmers, one mason, and one nitwit. Everytime night comes around, they all go to sleep. Steve did not know why. The next night when all the villagers return to sleep, monsters spawn everywhere. Steve realizes that this is irreversable and wonders if he is to blame. Steve takes it upon himself to protect and develop the village.

### History of Oppression
As Steve realized the amount of work required to build the town and its people, when all the townsmen went to sleep, he locked all the villagers in their homes. Steve left the village to go search for resources. During his search, he came across three more villages. He decided to also lock those villagers in their homes, and decided he would return one day to free them. They are still locked till this day...

### Period of Liberation
Once Steve finished fencing around the entire town of his original village, he kept his promise and freed the villagers. They were free to roam within the parameters of the city. Although the villagers were free to roam, Steve stole their jobs while he thought of a better way to organize the city.

### Renaissance
During the Renaissance, Villagers were able to attatin jobs. This led to a period of population growth, golem population growth, and many other discoveries and inventions. Because Steve was in control of the entire economy, there were many recessions. This led to unemployment, demotions, confusion, and dissapearing people...

### Villager Roles
